Overview
--------

Use the guides on this page to identify the potentially *breaking changes* that each
version of the {+driver-short+} introduces. 
A breaking change is a modification of a convention or a behavior starting in
a specific version of the driver. This type of change may prevent your application from
working properly if you don't address it.

.. tip:: {+stable-api+}

   To minimize the number of changes your application might require when
   you upgrade driver versions in the future, consider using the
   :ref:`{+stable-api+} <csharp-stable-api>`.
