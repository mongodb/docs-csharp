Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use and interact with **time series collections** in
MongoDB using the {+driver-long+}.

Time series collections efficiently store sequences of measurements over
a period of time. Time series data consists of any data collected over
time, metadata that describes the measurement, and the time of the
measurement.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 33, 33, 33
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Example
     - Measurement
     - Metadata

   * - Sales Data
     - Revenue
     - Company

   * - Infection Rates
     - Amount of People Infected
     - Location

Create a Time Series Collection
-------------------------------

To create a time series collection, pass the following parameters to the
`CreateCollection() <{+new-api-root+}/MongoDB.Driver/MongoDB.Driver.IMongoDatabase.CreateCollection.html>`__
method:

- The name of the new collection to create
- The `TimeSeriesOptions <{+new-api-root+}/MongoDB.Driver/MongoDB.Driver.TimeSeriesOptions.html>`__  for creating the collection in a `CreateCollectionOptions <{+new-api-root+}/MongoDB.Driver/MongoDB.Driver.CreateCollectionOptions.html>`__ object

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/TimeSeries.cs
   :start-after: begin-time-series
   :end-before: end-time-series
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

.. important::

   Time series collections require MongoDB 5.0 or later.

To check if you successfully created the collection, send the
``"listCollections"`` command to the `RunCommand() <{+new-api-root+}/MongoDB.Driver/MongoDB.Driver.IMongoDatabase.RunCommand.html>`__ method.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/TimeSeries.cs
   :start-after: begin-run-command
   :end-before: end-run-command
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

Your output will look similar to the following:

.. code-block:: json

    {
    "cursor":{
        ...
        "firstBatch":[
            {
                "name":"september2021",
                "type":"timeseries",
                "options":{
                "timeseries":{
                    ...
                }
                },
                "info":{
                "readOnly":false
                }
            },
    ...   
    }

Query a Time Series Collection
------------------------------

To query a time series collection, use the same conventions as you
would for :doc:`retrieving </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/retrieve>`
and aggregating data.

.. note:: Window Functions

   MongoDB version 5.0 introduces window functions into the aggregation
   pipeline. You can use window functions to perform operations on a
   contiguous span of time series data. For more information, see our
   :ref:`Aggregates Builders guide <builders-aggregates-setWindowFields>`.
