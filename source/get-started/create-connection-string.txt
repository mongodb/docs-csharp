Create a Connection String
==========================

You can connect to your MongoDB deployment by providing a
**connection URI**, also called a *connection string*, which
instructs the driver on how to connect to a MongoDB deployment
and how to behave while connected.

The connection string includes the hostname or IP address and 
port of your deployment, the authentication mechanism, user credentials 
when applicable, and connection options.

.. tip::
   
   To connect to a self-managed (non-Atlas) deployment, see
   :ref:`csharp-connect-to-mongodb`.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Find your MongoDB Atlas Connection String

      To retrieve your connection string for the deployment that
      you created in the :ref:`previous step <csharp-get-started-deploy-cluster>`,
      log into your Atlas account and navigate to the
      :guilabel:`Database` section and click the :guilabel:`Connect` button
      for your new deployment.

      Proceed to the :guilabel:`Connect your application` section and select
      "C# / .NET" from the :guilabel:`Driver` selection menu and the version
      that best matches the version you installed from the :guilabel:`Version`
      selection menu.

      Select the :guilabel:`Password (SCRAM)` authentication mechanism.
      
      Deselect the :guilabel:`Include full driver code example` option to view
      the connection string.

   .. step:: Copy your Connection String

      Click the button on the right of the connection string to copy it to
      your clipboard as shown in the following screenshot:

         :alt: The connection string copy button in the Atlas UI

   .. step:: Update the Placeholders

      Paste this connection string into a file in your preferred text editor
      and replace the ``<db_username>`` and ``<db_password>`` placeholders with
      your database user's username and password.
      
      Save this file to a safe location for use in the next step.
   
   .. step:: Set an Environment Variable

      In your shell, run the following code to save your MongoDB
      :ref:`connection string <csharp-connect-to-mongodb>` to an 
      environment variable. Replace ``<your MongoDB URI>`` with the connection
      string that you saved to a file in the previous step.

      .. code-block:: bash

         export MONGODB_URI="<your MongoDB URI>"

      .. note:: PowerShell

         If you're using Microsoft PowerShell, run the following command instead:
   
         .. code-block:: bash
   
            set MONGODB_URI="<your MongoDB URI>"

      Storing your credentials in an environment variable is safer than hardcoding them
      in your source code.   

After completing these steps, you have a connection string that
contains your database username and password.
