      In your shell, run the following commands to create a 
      directory called ``csharp-quickstart`` and initialize a {+framework+} project for
      a new console application:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir csharp-quickstart
         cd csharp-quickstart
         dotnet new console

   .. step:: Install {+driver-short+}

      Run the following command to install the current version of the {+driver-short+}
      as a dependency of your project:
      
      .. code-block:: bash

         dotnet add package MongoDB.Driver

After you complete these steps, you have a new {+framework+} project
and the {+driver-short+} installed.
