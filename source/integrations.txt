Entity Framework Provider
-------------------------

The MongoDB Entity Framework Provider is an object-relational mapper (ORM) that lets you
use Microsoft's Entity Framework to work with MongoDB data. ORMs provide an
object-oriented interface for data management.

The provider includes features such as the following:

- Intelligent object tracking
- Entity-based LINQ operations
- Entity Framework modeling and mapping with the fluent API
- Automatic database updates through change tracking

To learn more, see the
`MongoDB Entity Framework Provider documentation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/entity-framework/current/>`__.

{+analyzer+}
-------------------

The {+analyzer-short+} is a tool that helps you understand how your
{+driver-short+} code translates into the {+query-api+} and if your code
includes any unsupported LINQ or builder expressions. To learn more, see the
`{+analyzer-short+} documentation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-analyzer>`__.
