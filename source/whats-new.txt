What's New in 2.30

  Queryable Encryption, see :manual:`Queryable Encryption </core/queryable-encryption>`
  in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

For more information about this release, see the :github:`v2.29 release notes
</mongodb/mongo-csharp-driver/releases/tag/v2.29.0>`.

What's New in 2.28
------------------

.. warning:: Potential Breaking Change in v2.28

   - All {+driver-short+} components are strongly named. If your application
     has dependencies that reference multiple {+driver-short+}
     versions, you must create binding redirects to manage those dependencies.
     For more information, see :ref:`csharp-breaking-changes-2.28.0`.

The 2.28 driver release includes the following new features:

- Adds support for additional numeric conversions involving ``Nullable<T>``.
- Adds support for the ``delegated`` option when using KMIP for :ref:`CSFLE or
  Queryable Encryption <csharp-fle>`.

For more information about this release, see the :github:`v2.28 release notes

  Helper commands to avoid errors.

  connection string values when using the ``MONGODB-OIDC`` authentication
  mechanism. 

- Fixes a translation bug that caused an error during serialization involving
  numbers of different sizes.
