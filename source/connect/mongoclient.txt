This guide shows you how to connect to a MongoDB instance or replica set
deployment by using the {+driver-short+}.

.. _csharp_connection_uri:

Connection URI
--------------

A **connection URI**, also known as a *connection string*, tells the driver how to connect to a MongoDB deployment and how to behave while connected.

A standard connection string includes the following pieces:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Piece
     - Description

   * - ``mongodb://``

     - Required. A prefix that identifies this as a string in the
       standard connection format.

   * - ``username:password@``

     - Optional. Authentication credentials. If you include these, the client will authenticate the user against the database specified in ``authSource``. 

   * - ``host[:port]``

     - Required. The host and optional port number where MongoDB is running. If you don't include the port number, the driver will use the default port, ``27017``.

   * - ``/defaultauthdb``
     
     - Optional. The authentication database to use if the
       connection string includes ``username:password@``
       authentication credentials but not the ``authSource`` option. If you don't include 
       this piece, the client will authenticate the user against the ``admin`` database.

   * - ``?<options>``

     - Optional. A query string that specifies connection-specific
       options as ``<name>=<value>`` pairs. See
       :ref:`csharp-connection-options` for a full description of
       these options.

To use a connection URI, pass it as a string to the ``MongoClient`` constructor. In the 
following example, the driver uses a sample connection URI to connect to a MongoDB 
instance on port ``27017`` of ``localhost``: 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/connection/LocalConnection.cs
   :language: csharp
   :start-after: // start local connection
   :end-before: // end local connection

.. tip:: Reuse Your Client

   Because each ``MongoClient`` represents a pool of connections to the
   database, most applications require only a single instance of
   ``MongoClient``, even across multiple requests. To learn more about
   how connection pools work in the driver, see the :ref:`FAQ page
   <csharp-faq-connection-pool>`.

See :manual:`the MongoDB Manual </reference/connection-string>` for more information about creating a connection string.

MongoClientSettings
-------------------

You can use a ``MongoClientSettings`` object to configure the connection in code
rather than in a connection URI. To use a ``MongoClientSettings`` object, create an 
instance of the class and pass it as an argument to the ``MongoClient`` constructor. 

In the following example, the driver uses a ``MongoClientSettings`` object to connect to a 
MongoDB instance on port ``27017`` of ``localhost``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/connection/MongoClientSettings.cs
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:
   :start-after: // start mongo client settings
   :end-before: // end mongo client settings
