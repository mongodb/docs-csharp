Match
-----

Use the ``match()`` method to create a :manual:`$match </reference/operator/aggregation/match/>`
pipeline stage that matches incoming documents against the specified
query filter, filtering out documents that do not match.

.. tip::

   The filter can be an instance of any class that implements ``Bson``, but it's
   convenient to combine with use of the :ref:`Filters <filters-builders>` class.

The following example creates a pipeline stage that matches all documents where the
``title`` field is equal to "The Shawshank Redemption":

.. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation/Builders.cs
   :start-after: begin match
   :end-before: end match
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:
