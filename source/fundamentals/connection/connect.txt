This guide shows you how to connect to a MongoDB instance or replica set
deployment using the {+driver-short+}.

Connection URI
--------------

A **connection URI**, also known as a *connection string*, tells the driver how to connect to a MongoDB deployment and how to behave while connected.

A standard connection string includes the following pieces:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Piece
     - Description

   * - ``mongodb://``

     - Required. A prefix that identifies this as a string in the
       standard connection format.

   * - ``username:password@``

     - Optional. Authentication credentials. If you include these, the client will authenticate the user against the database specified in ``authSource``. 

   * - ``host[:port]``

     - Required. The host and optional port number where MongoDB is running. If you don't include the port number, the driver will use the default port, ``27017``.

   * - ``/defaultauthdb``
     
     - Optional. The authentication database to use if the
       connection string includes ``username:password@``
       authentication credentials but not the ``authSource`` option. If you don't include 
       this piece, the client will authenticate the user against the ``admin`` database.

   * - ``?<options>``

     - Optional. A query string that specifies connection-specific
       options as ``<name>=<value>`` pairs. See
       :ref:`csharp-connection-options` for a full description of
       these options.

To use a connection URI, pass it as a string to the ``MongoClient`` constructor. In the 
following example, the driver uses a sample connection URI to connect to a MongoDB 
instance on port ``27017`` of ``localhost``: 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/connection/LocalConnection.cs
   :language: csharp

.. tip::

    See :manual:`the MongoDB Manual</reference/connection-string>`: for more information about creating a connection string.

MongoClientSettings
-------------------

You can use a ``MongoClientSettings`` object to configure the connection in code
rather than in a connection URI. To use a ``MongoClientSettings`` object, create an 
instance of the class and pass it as an argument to the ``MongoClient`` constructor. 

In the following example, the driver uses a ``MongoClientSettings`` object to connect to a 
MongoDB instance on port ``27017`` of ``localhost``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/connection/MongoClientSettings.cs
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

Other Connection Targets
------------------------

Connect to Atlas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To connect to Atlas, create a client by passing your connection string
and any settings. You can set a Stable API server version as a setting
to avoid breaking changes when you upgrade to a new server version. To
learn more about the Stable API feature, see the :ref:`Stable API page
<csharp-stable-api>`.

The following code shows how you can instantiate a client that uses a
Stable API version and a sample connection string with placeholders for
your username and password. Instantiating the client creates a
connection to MongoDB:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/connection/AtlasConnection.cs
   :language: csharp

.. tip::

   If your deployment is hosted on Atlas, follow the
   :atlas:`Atlas driver connection guide </driver-connection?tck=docs_driver_nodejs>`
   to retrieve your connection string.

Connect to a Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To connect to a replica set deployment, specify the hostnames (or IP addresses) and 
port numbers of the members of the replica set.

If you aren't able to provide a full list of hosts in the replica set, you can 
specify one or more of the hosts in the replica set and instruct the driver to 
perform automatic discovery in one of the following ways:

- Specify the name of the replica set as the value of the ``replicaSet`` parameter.
- Specify ``false`` as the value of the ``directConnection`` parameter.
- Specify more than one host in the replica set.

In the following example, the driver uses a sample connection URI to connect to the 
MongoDB replica set ``sampleRS``, which is running on port ``27017`` of three different
hosts, including ``sample.host1``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/connection/ReplicaSetConnection.cs
   :language: csharp
