Overview
--------

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a RESTful API with endpoints that
perform basic create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations across MongoDB
Atlas.

Prequisites
-----------

To complete this tutorial, you must have the following:

- An `Atlas account
  <https://account.mongodb.com/account/register?tck=docs_atlas>`__ with a
  deployed and configured MongoDB Atlas cluster that is M0 or higher.

- .NET 6.0 or higher `installed <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download>`__ on your machine.

To learn how to get started with MongoDB Atlas and how to load sample data, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas Guide </getting-started>`. 

This tutorial uses .NET Core 8.0, but you can use any version later than .NET 6.0.

Set Up Your Project
-------------------

You can create a new .NET Core project using the web application template that
Microsoft offers. To do this, run the following commands in your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   dotnet new webapi -o MongoExample
   cd MongoExample

To add the {+driver-short+} to your project as a dependency, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   dotnet add package MongoDB.Driver

The preceding commands create a new web application project for .NET core named
``MongoExample`` and install the latest {+driver-short+}. The template project
includes some boilerplate files. During this tutorial, you will add to these
files and remove some of the boilerplate code to create a RESTful API. 

Design a Document Model and Database Service
--------------------------------------------

In this section, you will create and configure your MongoDB service and define
the data model for your RESTful API.

.. procedure:: Create a MongoDB Service
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Create the MongoDBSettings class

      Your MongoDB service will be responisble for establishing a connection and
      directly working with documents within MongoDB. In your project, create a
      folder named ``Models``. In the ``Models`` folder, create a new file named
      ``MongoDBSettings.cs``. In this file, add the following code:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/restful-api-tutorial/MongoDBSettingsSetup.cs
         :language: csharp
         :dedent:

      The preceding code defines a class named ``MongoDBSettings`` that
      contains information about your connection, the database name, and the
      collection name.

   .. step:: Update the appsettings.json file

      The data that will be stored in the class fields defined in the
      ``MongoDBSettings`` class is found in the projects' ``appsettings.json``
      file. Open this file and add the following:

      .. code-block:: json
         :copyable: true

         {
            "Logging": {
               "LogLevel": {
               "Default": "Information",
               "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
               }
            },
         "AllowedHosts": "*",
         "MongoDB": {
            "ConnectionURI": "ATLAS_URI_HERE",
            "DatabaseName": "sample_mflix",
            "CollectionName": "playlist"
            }
         }

      Note the ``MongoDB`` field. This tutorial uses the ``sample_mflix``
      database and the ``playlist`` collection. Replace the ``ATLAS_URI_HERE``
      placeholder with your MongoDB Atlas connection string. For more
      information on how to find your connection string, see the
      :ref:`csharp-quickstart` guide.

   .. step:: Create the service

      In your project, create a folder named ``Services``. In the ``Services``
      folder, create a new file named ``MongoDBService.cs`` and add the
      following code:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/restful-api-tutorial/MongoDBServiceSetup.cs
         :language: csharp
         :dedent:
      
      The preceding code defines a class named ``MongoDBService`` that includes
      empty asynchronous functions. In this tutorial, you will add code to these
      functions as you create your endpoints. The passed settings from the
      ``appsettings.json`` file are set to veriables.

   .. step:: Connect the service to the application

      Open the ``Program.cs`` file and add the following code to the top of the file:

      .. code-block:: csharp
         :copyable: true

         using MongoExample.Models;
         using MongoExample.Services;

         var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

         builder.Services.Configure<MongoDBSettings>(builder.Configuration.GetSection("MongoDB"));
         builder.Services.AddSingleton<MongoDBService>();

      In the preceding code, the ``GetSection`` function pulls your settings
      from the ``MongoDB`` field in the ``appsettings.json`` file. 
      
      .. tip::
         
         If your boilerplate code already has the ``builder`` variable, don't add it twice. 

   .. step:: Create the document model

      Now that the service is set up, you can create a data model for your collection.

      In the ``Models`` folder, create a new file named ``Playlist.cs`` and add
      the following code:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/restful-api-tutorial/PlaylistSetup.cs
         :language: csharp
         :dedent:

      In the preceding code, the ``Id`` field is represented as an ``ObjectId``
      in BSON and the ``_id`` fild within MongoDB. When you work with this
      locally in your application, it is a string.

      The ``movieIds`` field will be known as ``items``. When sending or
      receiving JSON, the field will also be known as ``items`` instead of
      ``movieIds``.

      If you plan to have your local class field match the document field
      directly, you don't need to define custom mappings. For example, the
      ``username`` field in the preceding code has no custom mappings. It will
      be ``username`` in C#, in JSON, and in MongoDB.

You now have a MongoDB service and document model for your collection to work
with for .NET Core.

Build CRUD Endpoints
--------------------

To create the CRUD endpoints for this application, you need to update two
different files within the project. In this section, you can learn how to define
the endpoint within a controller and update the corresponding work within the
service.

.. note::

   In this example project, there is no data validation for the HTTP requests.

.. procedure:: Build endpoints to interact with MongoDB
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Create a controller

      In your project, create a folder named ``Controllers``. In the
      ``Controllers`` folder, create a new file named ``PlaylistController.cs``
      and add the following code:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/restful-api-tutorial/PlaylistControllerSetup.cs
         :language: csharp
         :dedent:

      The ``PlaylistController`` class contains a constructor method that gains
      access to your singleton service class. Then, there is a series of
      endpoints for this controller.

   .. step:: Add data through the POST endpoint

      Go to ``Services/MongoDBService.cs`` and update the ``CreateAsync``
      function to use the following code:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/restful-api-tutorial/MongoDBServiceComplete.cs
         :language: csharp
         :start-after: start-create-async
         :end-before: end-create-async
         :dedent:

      The preceding code sets the ``_playlistCollection`` in the constructor
      method of the service. This lets your application use the
      ``InsertOneAsync`` method, which takes a passed ``Playlist`` variable and
      inserts it.

      To complete the creation of the POST endpoint, go to the
      ``Controllers/PlaylistController.cs`` file and update the ``Post`` method
      to use the following code:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/restful-api-tutorial/PlaylistControllerComplete.cs
         :language: csharp
         :start-after: start-post
         :end-before: end-post
         :dedent:

      When the ``POST`` endpoint executes, the application takes the
      ``Playlist`` object from the ``request``, which .NET Core parses, and
      passes it to the ``CreateAsync`` function in the service. After the
      insert, the code returns some information about the interaction.

   .. step:: Read data through the GET endpoint

      Go to ``Services/MongoDBService.cs`` and update the ``GetAsync`` function to
      use the following code:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/restful-api-tutorial/MongoDBServiceComplete.cs
         :language: csharp
         :start-after: start-get-async
         :end-before: end-get-async
         :dedent:

      The ``Find`` operation in the preceding code returns all documents that
      exist in the collection. 

      To complete the creation of the GET endpoint, go to the
      ``Controllers/PlaylistController.cs`` file and update the ``Get`` method to
      use the following code:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/restful-api-tutorial/PlaylistControllerComplete.cs
         :language: csharp
         :start-after: start-get
         :end-before: end-get
         :dedent:
      
   .. step:: Update data using the PUT endpoint

      Go to ``Services/MongoDBService.cs`` and update the ``AddToPlaylistAsync``
      function to use the following code:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/restful-api-tutorial/MongoDBServiceComplete.cs
         :language: csharp
         :start-after: start-add-to-playlist-async
         :end-before: end-add-to-playlist-async
         :dedent:

      The preceding code sets up a match filter to determine which document or
      documents receive an update, in this case adding an item to your playlist.
      The code matches based on the ``Id`` field, which is unique. Then, the
      code defines the update critera, which is an ``AddtoSet`` operation that
      only adds an item to the array if it doesn't already exist in the array.

      The ``UpdateOneAsync`` methods only updates on document even if the match
      filter returns more than one match.

      To complete the creation of the PUT endpoint, go to the
      ``Controllers/PlaylistController.cs`` file and update the
      ``AddToPlaylist`` function to use the following code:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/restful-api-tutorial/PlaylistControllerComplete.cs
         :language: csharp
         :start-after: start-put
         :end-before: end-put
         :dedent:
   
   .. step:: Delete data using the DELETE endpoint

      Go to ``Services/MongoDBService.cs`` and update the ``DeleteAsync`` function to
      use the following code:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/restful-api-tutorial/MongoDBServiceComplete.cs
         :language: csharp
         :start-after: start-delete-async
         :end-before: end-delete-async
         :dedent:

      The preceding code deletes a single document based on the filter criteria,
      which matches the unique value of the ``Id`` field.

      To complete the creation of the DELETE endpoint, go to the
      ``Controllers/PlaylistController.cs`` file and update the
      ``Delete`` function to use the following code:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/restful-api-tutorial/PlaylistControllerComplete.cs
         :language: csharp
         :start-after: start-delete
         :end-before: end-delete
         :dedent:

You now have a complete set of CRUD endpoints for your RESTful API.

Test Your API Endpoints
-----------------------

With the endpoints created, you can test them using the Swagger UI that is
built-in to the boilerplate .NET Core application. To do this, update your
``Program.cs`` file to include the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/restful-api-tutorial/MongoDBExampleProgram.cs
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-program-example
   :end-before: end-program-example

You can replace any repetitive code in the boilerplate with the preceding code.

Execute the following command to run your application:

.. code-block:: bash

   dotnet run

After the application starts, open your browser and go to your configured
localhost URL to access the Swagger UI, for example
``http://localhost:5000/swagger``. The Swagger UI looks like the following:

.. figure:: /includes/figures/restful-api-tutorial-swagger-ui.jpg
   :alt: Swagger UI
   :align: center

   The Swagger UI for the RESTful API.

You can test the application by clicking on the ``Try it out`` button on each
endpoint. To get started, go to the ``/api/Playlist`` ``POST`` endpoint
to add some data to the database. Add the following as dummy data:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: true

   {
      "username": "testuser",
      "items": [
         "1234",
         "5678"
      ]
   }

Run this request to insert data into the database. You can then go to the ``GET``
endpoint to see the data you just inserted. You can also test the ``PUT`` and
``DELETE`` endpoints to update and delete data.
