Appends a $changeStream stage to the pipeline. Normally you would prefer to use the Watch method of IMongoCollection<TDocument>. Only use this method if subsequent stages project away the resume token (the _id) or you don't want the resulting cursor to automatically resume.
Returns a Change Stream cursor on a collection, a database, or an entire cluster. Must be used as the first stage in an aggregation pipeline.
