This guide shows you how to connect to a MongoDB instance or replica set
deployment using the {+driver-short+}.

Connection URI
--------------

A **connection URI**, also known as a *connection string*, tells the driver how to connect to a MongoDB deployment and how to behave while connected.

A standard connection string includes the following pieces:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Piece
     - Description

   * - ``mongodb://``

     - Required. A prefix that identifies this as a string in the
       standard connection format.

   * - ``username:password@``

     - Optional. Authentication credentials. If you include these, the client will authenticate the user against the database specified in ``authSource``. 

   * - ``host[:port]``

     - Required. The host and optional port number where MongoDB is running. If you don't include the port number, the driver will use the default port, ``27017``.

   * - ``/defaultauthdb``
     
     - Optional. The authentication database to use if the
       connection string includes ``username:password@``
       authentication credentials but not the ``authSource`` option. If you don't include this piece, the client will authenticate the user against ``admin``.

   * - ``?<options>``

     - Optional. A query string that specifies connection-specific
       options as ``<name>=<value>`` pairs. See
       :ref:`csharp-connection-options` for a full description of
       these options.

.. tip::

    See :manual:`the MongoDB Manual</reference/connection-string>`: for more information about creating a connection string.

Connection Targets
------------------

Connect to a Standalone Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following example, the driver uses a sample connection URI to connect to a MongoDB instance on port ``27017`` of ``sample.host`` with the credentials ``user1`` and ``password1``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/StandaloneConnection.cs
   :language: csharp

Connect to Atlas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following example, the driver uses a sample connection URI to connect to a MongoDB instance on Atlas with the credentials ``user1`` and ``password1``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/AtlasConnection.cs
   :language: csharp

.. tip::

   If your deployment is hosted on Atlas, follow the
   :atlas:`Atlas driver connection guide </driver-connection?tck=docs_driver_nodejs>`
   to retrieve your connection string.

Connect to Your Local Machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following example, the driver uses a sample connection URI to connect to a MongoDB instance on port ``27017`` of ``localhost``: 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/LocalConnection.cs
   :language: csharp

Connect to a Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following example, the driver uses a sample connection URI to connect to the MongoDB replica set ``sampleRS``, which is running on port ``27017`` of ``sample.host1``, ``sample.host2``, and ``sample.host3``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/ReplicaSetConnection.cs
   :language: csharp
