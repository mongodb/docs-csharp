Documents
---------

Use the ``documents()`` method to create a
:manual:`$documents </reference/operator/aggregation/documents/>`
pipeline stage that returns literal documents from input values.

.. important::

   If you use a ``$documents`` stage in an aggregation pipeline, it must be the first
   stage in the pipeline.

The following example creates a pipeline stage that creates
sample documents with a ``title`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation/Builders.cs
   :start-after: // begin documents
   :end-before: // end documents
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

.. important::

   If you use the ``documents()`` method to provide the input to an aggregation pipeline,
   you must call the ``aggregate()`` method on a database instead of on a
   collection.
