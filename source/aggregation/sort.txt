Sort
----

Use the ``sort()`` method to create a  :manual:`$sort </reference/operator/aggregation/sort/>`
pipeline stage to sort by the specified criteria.

.. tip::

   Though the sort criteria can be an instance of any class that
   implements ``Bson``, it's convenient to combine with use of :ref:`Sorts <sorts-builders>`.

The following example creates a pipeline stage that sorts in descending order according
to the value of the ``year`` field and then in ascending order according to the
value of the ``title`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation/Builders.cs
   :start-after: // begin sortStage
   :end-before: // end sortStage
