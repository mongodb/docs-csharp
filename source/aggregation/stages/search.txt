Atlas Full-Text Search
----------------------

Use the ``search()`` method to create a :manual:`$search </reference/operator/aggregation/search/>`
pipeline stage that specifies a full-text search of one or more fields.

.. tip:: Only Available on Atlas for MongoDB v4.2 and later

   This aggregation pipeline operator is only available for collections hosted
   on :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas </>` clusters running v4.2 or later that are
   covered by an :atlas:`Atlas search index </reference/atlas-search/index-definitions/>`.
   Learn more about the required setup and the functionality of this operator
   from the :ref:`Atlas Search <fts-top-ref>` documentation.

The following example creates a pipeline stage that searches the ``title``
field for text that contains the word "Future":

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggregateSearchBuilderExample.java
   :start-after: // begin atlasTextSearch
   :end-before: // end atlasTextSearch
   :language: csharp
