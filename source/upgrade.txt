Overview
--------

In this section, you can identify the changes you need to make to your
application to upgrade your driver to a new version.

Before you upgrade, perform the following actions:

- Ensure the new version is compatible with the MongoDB Server versions
  your application connects to and the .Net version your
  application runs on. See the :ref:`.Net/C# Driver Compatibility <csharp-compatibility-tables>`
  page for this information.
- Address any breaking changes between the current version of the driver
  your application is using and your planned upgrade version in the
  :ref:`Breaking Changes <csharp-breaking-changes>` section. To learn
  more about the MongoDB Server release compatibility changes, see the
  :ref:`<csharp-server-release-changes>` section.

.. tip::

   To minimize the amount of changes your application may require when
   upgrading driver versions in the future, use the
   :ref:`{+stable-api+} <csharp-stable-api>`.

.. _csharp-breaking-changes:

Breaking Changes
----------------

A breaking change is a modification in a convention or behavior in
a specific version of the driver that may prevent your application from
working properly if not addressed before upgrading.

The breaking changes in this section are categorized by the driver version that
introduced them. When upgrading driver versions, address all the breaking
changes between the current and upgrade versions. For example, if you
are upgrading the driver from v2.0 to v2.20, address all breaking changes from
the version after v2.0 including any listed under v2.20.

Version 2.19.0 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``ObjectSerializer`` has been changed to only allow deserialization of
  types that are considered safe. What types are considered safe is
  determined by a new configurable ``AllowedTypes`` function (of type
  ``Func<Type, bool>``). The default ``AllowedTypes`` function is
  ``ObjectSerializer.DefaultAllowedTypes`` which returns true for a
  number of well-known framework types that we have deemed safe.
  A typical example might be to allow all the default allowed types as
  well as your own types. This could be accomplished as follows:

  .. code-block:: csharp

     var objectSerializer = new ObjectSerializer(
        type => ObjectSerializer.DefaultAllowedTypes(type) || type.FullName.StartsWith("MyNamespace"));
     BsonSerializer.RegisterSerializer(objectSerializer);
    
  More information about the ``ObjectSerializer`` can be found in our
  :ref:`FAQ <csharp-faq-object-serializer>`.

Server Release Compatibility Changes
------------------------------------

A server release compatibility change is a modification
to the MongoDB .NET/C# Driver that discontinues support for a set of
MongoDB Server versions.

The driver discontinues support for a MongoDB Server version after it
reaches end-of-life(EOL).

To learn more about the MongoDB support for EOL products see the `Legacy
Support Policy <https://www.mongodb.com/support-policy/legacy>`__. 

To learn more about the compatibility between .NET/C# driver versions
and MongoDB Server versions, visit the
:ref:`Compatibility page<csharp-compatibility-tables>`. 

Version 2.14 Release Support Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The v2.14 driver drops support for MongoDB Server 3.4 and earlier. To
  use any driver from v2.14 and up, your MongoDB Server must be v3.6 or
  later. To learn how to upgrade your MongoDB Server to v3.6, follow the
  link that corresponds to your MongoDB deployment configuration:

  - :ref:`<3.6-upgrade-replica-set>`
  - :ref:`<3.6-upgrade-standalone>`
  - :ref:`<3.6-upgrade-sharded-cluster>`
