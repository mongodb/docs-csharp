==================
Run a Sample Query
==================

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Create your {+lang-framework+} Application
      
      Copy and paste the following code into the ``Program.cs`` file in your application:
      
      .. literalinclude:: /includes/quick-start/Program.cs
         :language: csharp
         :dedent:

   .. step:: Run your Application

      In your shell, run the following command to start this application:
      
      .. code-block:: sh

         dotnet run csharp-quickstart.csproj

      The output includes details of the retrieved movie document:

      .. code-block:: none

         {
           _id: ...,
           plot: 'A young man is accidentally sent 30 years into the past...',
           genres: [ 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Sci-Fi' ],
           ...
           title: 'Back to the Future',
           ...
         }

      .. tip::

         If you encounter an error or see no output, ensure that you specified the
         proper connection string, and that you loaded the
         sample data.

After you complete these steps, you have a working application that
uses the driver to connect to your MongoDB deployment, runs a query on
the sample data, and prints out the result.
