      .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir csharp-quickstart
         cd csharp-quickstart
         dotnet new console

   .. step:: Install the {+driver-short+}

      Run the following command to install the current version of the {+driver-short+}
      as a dependency of your project:
      
      .. code-block:: bash
