Delete a Document

You can delete a document from a collection by using the synchronous
`DeleteOne() <{+api-root+}/Overload_MongoDB_Driver_IMongoCollectionExtensions_DeleteOne.htm>`__
method, or the asynchronous `DeleteOneAsync() <{+api-root+}/Overload_MongoDB_Driver_IMongoCollectionExtensions_DeleteOneAsync.htm>`__ method. Both methods use a **query filter** which specifies the search criteria.

.. note::

   The ``DeleteOne()`` method deletes only the first document that matches the filter. To delete more than one document, use the ``DeleteMany()`` method.
   TODO: Link to DeleteMany usage example page.

Examples
--------

These examples use the following ``Restaurant`` class as a model:

.. literalinclude:: ../includes/code-examples/DeleteOneAsync.cs
   :start-after: start-model
   :end-before: end-model
   :language: csharp
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

Delete a Document Using Builders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: builders-async

      The following example uses builders to asynchronously delete a document in 
      the ``restaurants`` collection with the ``name`` "Ready Penny Inn".

      .. literalinclude:: ../includes/code-examples/DeleteOneAsync.cs
         :start-after: start-delete-one-builders-async
         :end-before: end-delete-one-builders-async
         :language:  csharp
         :copyable:
         :dedent:

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: builders-sync

      The following example uses builders to synchronously delete a document in 
      the ``restaurants`` collection with the ``name`` "Ready Penny Inn".

      .. literalinclude:: ../includes/code-examples/DeleteOne.cs
         :start-after: start-delete-one-builders
         :end-before: end-delete-one-builders
         :language:  csharp
         :copyable:
         :dedent:

Expected Result
