Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to remove documents from your MongoDB
collections using delete operations.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The example in this guide use the ``restaurants`` collection
from the ``sample_restaurants`` database. The documents in this
collection are modeled by the following ``Restaurant`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/crud/delete.cs
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-model
   :end-before: end-model

Delete Operations
-----------------

Use **delete operations** to remove data from MongoDB. Delete operations
use the following methods:

- ``DeleteOne()``, which deletes *the first document* that matches the
  query filter
- ``DeleteMany()``, which deletes *all documents* that match the query
  filter

If you are using asynchronous programming in your application, you can
use the ``DeleteOneAsync()`` and ``DeleteManyAsync()`` methods for your
delete operations. Find examples using these methods under :ref:`additional information <additional-info>`.

.. tip::

   If only one document matches your filter when using the ``DeleteMany()``
   method, the operation is equivalent to using the ``DeleteOne()`` method.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``DeleteOne()`` and ``DeleteMany()`` methods expect you to pass a query filter specifying which
documents to match.

Return Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``DeleteOne()`` and ``DeleteMany()`` methods return a
``DeleteResult`` type. This type contains the ``DeletedCount`` property,
which describes the number of documents deleted. If your filter does not
match any documents, no documents are deleted and ``DeletedCount`` is
``0``.

Example
```````
The following code uses the ``DeleteMany()`` method to delete all
documents whose ``address.street`` field value includes the phrase
"Pearl Street":

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: csharp

      var filter = Builders<Restaurant>.Filter
          .Regex("address.street", "Pearl Street");

      WriteLine("Deleting documents...");
      var result = _restaurantsCollection.DeleteMany(filter);
      
      WriteLine($"Deleted documents: {result.DeletedCount}");

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false
      
      Deleting documents...
      Deleted documents: 26

.. tip::

   If the preceding example used the ``DeleteOne()`` method instead of
   ``DeleteMany()``, the driver would delete the first of the 26
   matched documents.
