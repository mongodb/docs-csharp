Use the ``out()`` method to create an :manual:`$out </reference/operator/aggregation/out/>`
pipeline stage that writes all documents to the specified collection in
the same database.

.. important::

   The ``$out`` stage must be the last stage in any aggregation pipeline.

The following example writes the results of the pipeline to the ``authors``
collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation/Builders.cs
   :start-after: // begin out
   :end-before: // end out
